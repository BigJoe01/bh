  <p class="lead">Combine the beauty of Bootstrap’s design and the expressiveness of Ruby to get the best of both worlds with the least amount of keystrokes.</p>

  <p>Bootstrap is a great framework, but requires you to write <mark>many lines of HTML code</mark> even for simple components.<br />
  For instance, here's the HTML you'd need to write to show a dismissible alert:</p>
    <div class="bs-html"></div>
    {% highlight html %}
<div class="alert alert-info alert-dismissible" role="alert">
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">
    <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
    <span class="sr-only">Close</span>
  </button>
  You accepted the Terms of service.
</div>
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>That's a lot to remember, and it clutters your views with boilerplate.</p>
  <p>With Bh, you can achieve the same thing with <mark>just one line of code</mark>:</p>
  {% highlight rhtml %}
<%= alert_box 'You accepted the Terms of service.', dismissible: true %>
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h3 id="overview-install">How to install</h3>
  <p>You can use Bh with Rails or any Ruby web framework that supports ERB templates.</p>
  <p>Require the bh gem in the project’s Gemfile with <code>gem 'bh'</code>, and you are good to go!</p>
  <p>Bh does not overwrite any default helper or Bootstrap style, giving you the freedom to use <em>both</em> Bh helpers
    <em>and</em> the traditional way of writing Bootstrap components.</p>
  <p>The list of available helpers is detailed hereafter.</p>
